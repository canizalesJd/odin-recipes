      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol class="recipe-steps">
        <li>
          Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in
          cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist,
          malleable dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
          into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches
          until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked
          arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to
          handle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated
          knife to form a pita-like pocket.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
